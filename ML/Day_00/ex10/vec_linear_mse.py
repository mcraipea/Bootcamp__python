def vec_linear_mse(x, y, theta):
	"""Computes the mean squared error of three non-empty numpy.ndarray,
	without any for-loop. The three arrays must have compatible dimensions.
	Args:
	y: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
	x: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrix of dimesion m * n.
	theta: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension n * 1.
	Returns:
	The mean squared error as a float.
	None if y, x, or theta are empty numpy.ndarray.
	None if y, x or theta does not share compatibles dimensions.
	Raises:
	This function should not raise any Exception.
